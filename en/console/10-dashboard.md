# Dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 The dashboard is the landing page after you log in to the console. It directs you to your last-used organization and project.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

When you access the console, the dashboard automatically redirects you based on your current context.

***

## Redirect Behavior

| Context | Redirect Target |
|---------|----------------|
| Organization and project already selected | Project overview page |
| Organization selected, no project | Organization home page |
| No organization | Console home with **Create Organization** prompt |

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 If you have previously selected an organization and project, the console remembers your selection and redirects you directly.
{% endhint %}
