    title: "What's New in Next.js 16",
    content:
      "Next.js 16 has arrived with a host of exciting new features. Turbopack is now the default bundler, delivering 2-5x faster production builds and up to 10x faster Fast Refresh.\n\nOne of the most notable changes is the new caching model with Cache Components. The 'use cache' directive provides explicit opt-in caching, replacing the previous experimental PPR flag.\n\nThe middleware.ts file has been renamed to proxy.ts, making the app's network boundary explicit. React 19.2 integration brings View Transitions, useEffectEvent(), and the Activity component.\n\nYou can incrementally upgrade existing projects by following the migration guide. Most changes maintain backward compatibility.",

    title: "The Complete Guide to TypeScript Type Guards",
    content:
      "Type guards in TypeScript are essential techniques for narrowing types at runtime. We'll cover basic type guards using typeof, instanceof, and the in operator, as well as user-defined type guards.\n\nThe typeof guard is used to distinguish primitive types. You can check for string, number, boolean, and other types at runtime.\n\nUser-defined type guards use the `is` keyword to encapsulate complex type validation logic into functions. This improves code readability and reusability.\n\nWhen combined with Discriminated Unions, you can achieve safe branching similar to pattern matching.",

Start early to beat the crowds and enjoy the scenic hillside trails in the afternoon.\n\nDay 2: Explore the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Tenryu-ji Temple. The bamboo forest walk takes about an hour and offers stunning photo opportunities.\n\nDay 3: Discover the Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji) and Ryoan-ji rock garden.

    title: "Understanding React Server Components",
    content:
      "React Server Components (RSC) represent a new component paradigm that renders on the server. They reduce client bundle size and improve initial load performance.\n\nRSC can directly access databases and file systems, allowing you to skip the API layer entirely. This helps solve the data fetching waterfall problem.\n\nThe 'use client' directive explicitly distinguishes client components. Use client components only when you need state management, event handlers, or browser APIs.\n\nRSC and SSR are different concepts. RSC is component-level server execution, while SSR is page-level HTML generation.",

      "Fresh homemade pasta offers a texture that's worlds apart from dried pasta. All you need is flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt.\n\nThe dough ratio is 1 egg per 100g of flour. Knead until smooth for about 10 minutes, then wrap in plastic and rest for at least 30 minutes.\n\nIf you don't have a pasta machine, a rolling pin works just fine. Roll the dough to 1-2mm thickness and cut into your desired shape. Tagliatelle or fettuccine are great choices for beginners.\n\nFor fresh pasta, 2-3 minutes of cooking time is all you need. Reserve some pasta water to help your sauce emulsify beautifully.",

    content:
      "Container Queries are a responsive design tool that goes beyond the limitations of media queries. Instead of the viewport, you can change styles based on the size of the parent container.\n\nUse the container-type property to designate a container, then write conditional styles with the @container rule. You can use values like inline-size and block-size.\n\nThis is especially useful for reusable components like sidebars, card grids, and dashboard widgets. The same component automatically adjusts its layout depending on where it's placed.\n\nAs of 2024, all major browsers support Container Queries, so they're safe to use in production environments.",

Basic equipment and quality beans are all it takes.\n\nIced Americano: Pull 2 shots of espresso and pour them over a glass full of ice with 200ml of cold water. Medium roast beans work best.\n\nCafe Latte: Heat milk to 60 degrees Celsius and froth it with a French press. Pour gently over the espresso for a smooth finish.\n\nCold Brew: Mix coarsely ground coffee with water at a 1:10 ratio and extract in the refrigerator for 12-18 hours.

Utilizing parallel execution can significantly reduce the overall pipeline time.\n\nIn the CD stage, auto-deploy to a staging environment first, then proceed to production after an approval process. You can choose between Blue-Green or Canary deployment strategies.\n\nApplying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) alongside allows you to version-control your environment configurations, maintaining reproducible infrastructure.",

Rather than grand plans, start with small, actionable habits.\n\nSimple routines like waking up at the same time every day, drinking a glass of water, and doing 10 minutes of stretching can help you take charge of your day.\n\nThe key is reducing 'decision fatigue.' By eliminating the time spent deciding what to do in the morning, you can focus your energy on the decisions that truly matter.\n\nRoutines take about 66 days -- not 21 -- to become ingrained habits.

Developers can now focus more on business logic and architecture.\n\nHowever, the ability to review and optimize AI-generated code still falls on humans. Code review skills and system design capabilities are becoming even more important.\n\nPrompt engineering has also emerged as a key developer skill. The productivity gap between developers who effectively leverage AI tools and those who don't continues to widen.",
